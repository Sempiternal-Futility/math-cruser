THIS CALCULATOR IS MEANT TO BE USED WITH "cool-retro-term" WHICH IS A TERMINAL EMULATOR.
IF YOU TRY TO USE THIS IN ANOTHER PTS, IT WILL PROBABLY LOOK TOO SMALL. cool-retro-term IS MORE ZOOMED IN.

I MIGHT MAKE THIS COMPATIBLE WITH MORE ZOOMED OUT TERMINAL EMULATORS THOUGH, IDK :/

THIS IS REALLY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT BTW :)
